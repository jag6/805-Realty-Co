This is a key part in marking and ultimately selling your home. It can be tempting to leave the home “as is” and just snap a few quick photos on your home and call it good. However, this great disservice to yourself. We, the listing broker, will pay for professional photographers to shoot your home. This gives it the best look and exposure to a large market of potential buyers.</p>

This is the biggest and most widely used MLS in all of CA. Listing your home in the MLS will allow it to filter out to 3rd party sites such as Zillow and Realtor.com. This allows for maximum market exposure.</p>

                        <p>Once listed on the MLS, we will start receiving calls for showings. Other agents will want to walk through the home with their buyers. For this part, we ask that you as the owners, if still living in the home, not be present for this. Buyers feel most at ease when they are allowed to view the home in private. However, this does not mean strangers will be in your home unsupervised. At all times buyers will be accompanied by a real estate professional.</p>

During escrow which is usually 30 days (but may be shorter or longer), the buyer will have a chance to do their “due diligence”. This means, perform any inspections and requesting any repairs be made if any.</p>

                        <p>After the buyer performs inspections and any repairs are completed, the buyer will be asked to remove all contingencies. This means they will no longer be able to back out of the sale without risking losing their initial deposit. When a buyer does this, they are “all in” so to speak. Not long after this escrow can be closed and all parties involved can receive their funds or home.</p>

                        <p>After opening escrow, the buyer will usually have 17 days (this may be shorter or longer) to perform their “due diligence”. This means we will conduct inspections of the interior/exterior to make sure you as the buyer are fully aware of any and all material facts. This may include damages to the home, broken appliances, etc.</p>

                        <p>While conducting our inspections, the buyer may become aware of some issues that concern them. It is at this point the buyer has the option to make a formal “request for repairs” to the seller. That is, formally requesting in writing that the seller fix X, Y, and Z before the close of escrow. Sometimes, in place of actual repairs, the buyer may choose to receive a credit from the seller in the amount of the repairs costs at the close of escrow. Or in the end, regardless of any damages, the buyer may choose to accept the home “as is” and make no request for repairs.</p>

                        <p>Usually after 17 days (can be shorter or longer), the buyer will be asked by the seller to remove any and all contingencies. Once the buyer does this, they have given up their right to back out of the sale without any repercussions. I.e. losing their initial deposit. A buyer who has removed all contingencies can be said to be “all in” on the transaction.</p>

                        <h2>Determining Approx. Down Payment/Loan Amount</h2>
                        <p>Initially, you will want to have a good idea of how much money you can afford to “put down” on a piece of real estate. This will help you determine how much you will need to borrow from a lender, and ultimately the price range of the home you can afford.</p>

                        <h2>Vetting Lenders</h2>
                        <p>Usually contacting 2 or 3 lenders is a good idea. Every lender works a little differently and offers different lending products which suit specific financial needs. Not to mention one lender may be able to get you a better rate than another. A simple phone call or quick meeting in person can help you as the barrow understand what products the lender offers and if any would best suit your needs. Whichever lender you choose, they should be trustworthy, communicate clearly and honestly, and you should feel comfortable calling them as you will likely have many questions throughout the process.</p>

                        <h2>Selecting a Lender & the App</h2>
                        <p class="padding">Once you select a lender, they will ask you to fill out a loan application. This may be done in person or some may have you fill out the app online. They will inquire about your financial background such as annual income, debts, assets, etc. The lender will all of this to determine if you qualify for the loan amount you have requested. The lender may also do perform a “soft pull” on your credit. This should not affect your score. However, if the lender decides to do a “hard pull”, this can affect your credit score. Be sure to ask your lender which type of pull they are doing and why.</p>
                        <p>Again, repeating this process with another lender may be advantageous as one lender may be able to approve you over another simply because they may better specialize in lending to your specific lending needs.</p>

                        <h2>Pre-Approved</h2>
                        <p class="padding">If the lender determines you qualify for a loan, they will likely write you a “pre-approval” letter stating the amount you are approved to borrow. This letter is key in the real estate transaction. Shopping for a home without such a letter doesn’t serve the buyer well because the buyer really doesn’t know if they can purchase the home they’re looking at.</p>
                        <p>Some lenders will write a general letter that simply states how much you as the buyer are approved to borrow. Other lenders will only write “property-specific” letters. General letters are preferred as they can be presented on any potential purchase as proof that the buyer has the funds to complete the purchase. Whereas “property-specific” letters will need to be recreated for each home the buyer wants to make an offer on. This can take valuable time in the tight time frame of a real estate transaction.

                        <h2>Full Loan Approval & Funding</h2>
                        <p>After an accepted offer and all inspections have been completed and approved, the time will come for the lender to fund the transaction. To do this the lender will likely review the loan again in its entirety and then give “full loan approval”. Once this has happened, they can fund the loan. I.e. send the funds to escrow. This would complete the loan process and close the real estate transaction.</p>
